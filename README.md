I'm a graduate student at UW, doing masters in analytics.  An english literature undergrad turned data science post grad, I'm a bit of an acadmeic nomad with an ardent love for math and humanities alike. I love telling stories that matter, backed by fact and evidence, and was luckily enough to turn this passion into fruition at the United Nations and later, a social impact consulting firm.
